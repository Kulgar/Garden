The project has the BLTIconnect plugin already installed. I also made some improvement so that the plugin no longer store the LTI ID inside the "username" but rather in a new LtiID column. 

The plugin "FirstLastName" is also installed so that we can have a clean username AND first/last name (or nickname) - as in  Vanilla 2.0.18, the username can't store any spaces or special characters (which is bad if you want to show a human friendly user name).
